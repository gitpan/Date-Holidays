TODO file for Date-Holidays

$Id: TODO 1742 2007-02-22 19:47:55Z jonasbn $

- Investigate whether we need an adapter at all

- Look into implementing a Class Adapter pattern for exposure of adaptee's
  extended APIs

- Test Date::Holidays with Date::Holidays:CN (China)

- Test Date::Holidays with Date::Holidays:AT (Austria)

- Test Date::Holidays with Date::Holidays:ES (Spain)

- Add ICal export features
    http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2445.html, undecided on which CPAN
    module to use.

- Add more documentation on OOP or procedural approach
  
From processing of test results from bin/test_date-holidays_modules.t

- Date::Holidays::UK misses holidays or similar method

- Date::Holidays::FR misses holidays or similar method

- Date::Holiday::PT misses holidays or similar method

- Date::Holidays::DE misses is_holiday or similar method

- Check out how to do integration with Data::ICal

--

- Should the holidays and is_holiday methods return return values others than
  undef in order for Date::Holidays to act as real super class or should I
  implement Date::Holidays::Super as an alternative to Date::Holidays::Abstract.

  DONE, available on CPAN

- BORUP suggests letting is_holiday and holidays take DateTime objects as 
  parameters and also returning results of these types or DateTime::Spans.

  DONE, added as an experiment to 0.02
