TODO file for Date-Holidays

$Id: TODO 1337 2004-05-23 15:19:48Z jonasbn $

From processing of test results from bin/test_date-holidays_modules.t

- Date::Holidays::UK misses holidays or similar method

- Date::Holidays::FR misses holidays or similar method

- Date::Holiday::PT misses holidays or similar method

- Date::Holidays::DE misses is_holiday or similar method

- Date::Japanese::Holiday cannot be called in the expected way, since it is
  OOP and requires the class name (I consider leaving this module out all 
  together) 

--

- Should the holidays and is_holiday methods return return values others than
  undef in order for Date::Holidays to act as real super class or should I
  implement Date::Holidays::Super as an alternative to Date::Holidays::Abstract.
