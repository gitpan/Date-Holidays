TODO file for Date-Holidays

$Id: TODO 1352 2004-05-29 07:45:16Z jonasbn $

From processing of test results from bin/test_date-holidays_modules.t

- Date::Holidays::UK misses holidays or similar method

- Date::Holidays::FR misses holidays or similar method

- Date::Holiday::PT misses holidays or similar method

- Date::Holidays::DE misses is_holiday or similar method

- Date::Japanese::Holiday cannot be called in the expected way, since it is
  OOP and requires the class name (I consider leaving this module out all 
  together) 

--

- Should the holidays and is_holiday methods return return values others than
  undef in order for Date::Holidays to act as real super class or should I
  implement Date::Holidays::Super as an alternative to Date::Holidays::Abstract.

- BORUP suggests letting is_holiday and holidays take DateTime objects as 
  parameters and also returning results of these types or DateTime::Spans.

  DONE, added as an experiment to 0.02
