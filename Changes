0.08 (Wed Sep  6 16:55:04 CEST 2006)

- Added RT request #21089, helper scripts not part of distribution, but
  mentioned in the autogenerated Makefile.PL
  
  Renamed bin/ directory to scripts/


0.07 (Released Wed Aug  2 22:14:45 CEST 2006)

- Removed bin/ directory from distribution (it is development purpose only 
  anyway)

- Removed t/pod.t (and prerequisites in Build.PL) this test can be 
  performed by Module::Build

- Removed t/pod-coverage.t (and prerequisites in Build.PL) this test can be 
  performed by Module::Build

- Updated TODO with new point

- Changed way Makefile.PL is generated from 'passthrough' to 'traditional', I 
  kind of like the way it is done in Workflow, so I adapted this

- FIxed a bug in program flow concerning Date::Holidays::DE

- Fixed a test holding a wrong number of tests to be skipped

- Updated POD, added Date::Holidays::CN to SEE ALSO section (no work done to 
  implement this at this time

- Updated POD with TEST COVERAGE section, planning next release to be a 
  maintenance release focused on test coverage
  
  Also in an attempt to address:

0.06 (Released Sun Dec 17 2005)

- Moved build requirements to special section in Build.PL

- Added AU and NZ to bin/test_date-holidays.t

- Updated MANIFEST.SKIP with:
    - Komodo project file
    - Module::Build parameters mentioned in Module::Signature

- Signed module using Module::Signature, added:
    - t/0-signature.t
    - SIGNATURE

- Parameter 'state' also added for holidays method, have sent patch to David 
  Dick author of Date::Holidays::AU requesting a more flexible API.

- Added some more POD on developing in the Date::Holidays::* namespace
  
- Date::Holidays::AU have been updated to 0.03, meaning that the exception
  implemented in 0.05 could be removed, it was however changed to accomodate
  the state parameter implemented in Date::Holidays::AU.

- Exchanged manually built Makefile.PL for a Makefile.PL maintained by
  Module::Build


0.05 (Released Fri Dec 9 2005)

- Addressing failing test
	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/262252

	So we have added yet another exception, this time for Date::Holidays::AU.

	The problem is that its method is_holiday, needs an additional parameter
	indicating the state, the holidays method in the same module defaults
	to VIC, so for know we are using this as our default state, this will need
	readdressing.


0.04 (Released 22. October 2005)

- Changes to unit-tests, it was assumed that some of the Date::Holidays
  modules where installed, this is not always the case
  
  This was pointed out to me by shild on use.perl.org:
  http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=28993&cid=43889


0.03 (Released 13. October 2005)

- Small refactoring added new sub _check_countries

- Moved portuguese exception, Date::Holiday::PT has changed name to 
  Date::Holidays::PT, but it has turned OOP.

- Implemented new parameter in is_holiday (countries). This method  returns a 
  list of country codes having the holiday specified as a holiday for the 
  respective country (suggested by cog).
  
  So it has to be used in conjunction with the data parameters: year, month and 
  day
  
  if given a subset of countries only these countries are tested and a hashref 
  is returned pointing where the countries codes are the keys and the values 
  indicate true or false for the date specified.
  
  The values are:
  
  	- undef if the country has no module or the data could not be obtained
  	- a name of the holiday if a holiday is present
  	- an empty string if the a module was located but the day is not a holiday

- Updated INSTALL

- Removed Exporter from prerequisites

- 'jp' left out of the test suite for now

- Added experimental subs using DateTime objects as suggested by BORUP 
  (Christian Borup) (SEE: TODO)
