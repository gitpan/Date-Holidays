Changes file for Date-Holidays

$Id: Changes 1594 2005-10-13 10:07:51Z jonasbn $

0.03 (Released 13. October 2005)

- Small refactoring added new sub _check_countries

- Moved portuguese exception, Date::Holiday::PT has changed name to 
  Date::Holidays::PT, but it has turned OOP.

- Implemented new parameter in is_holiday (countries). This method  returns a 
  list of country codes having the holiday specified as a holiday for the 
  respective country (suggested by cog).
  
  So it has to be used in conjunction with the data parameters: year, month and 
  day
  
  if given a subset of countries only these countries are tested and a hashref 
  is returned pointing where the countries codes are the keys and the values 
  indicate true or false for the date specified.
  
  The values are:
  
  	- undef if the country has no module or the data could not be obtained
  	- a name of the holiday if a holiday is present
  	- an empty string if the a module was located but the day is not a holiday
