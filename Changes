0.05 (Released Fri Dec 9 2005)

- Addressing failing test
	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/262252

	So we have added yet another exception, this time for Date::Holidays::AU.

	The problem is that its method is_holiday, needs an additional parameter
	indicating the state, the holidays method in the same module defaults
	to VIC, so for know we are using this as our default state, this will need
	readdressing.


0.04 (Released 22. October 2005)

- Changes to unit-tests, it was assumed that some of the Date::Holidays
  modules where installed, this is not always the case
  
  This was pointed out to me by shild on use.perl.org:
  http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=28993&cid=43889


0.03 (Released 13. October 2005)

- Small refactoring added new sub _check_countries

- Moved portuguese exception, Date::Holiday::PT has changed name to 
  Date::Holidays::PT, but it has turned OOP.

- Implemented new parameter in is_holiday (countries). This method  returns a 
  list of country codes having the holiday specified as a holiday for the 
  respective country (suggested by cog).
  
  So it has to be used in conjunction with the data parameters: year, month and 
  day
  
  if given a subset of countries only these countries are tested and a hashref 
  is returned pointing where the countries codes are the keys and the values 
  indicate true or false for the date specified.
  
  The values are:
  
  	- undef if the country has no module or the data could not be obtained
  	- a name of the holiday if a holiday is present
  	- an empty string if the a module was located but the day is not a holiday
